# adobe.io-target-postman
This is a Postman file derived from the one provided by Adobe at
http://developers.adobetarget.com/api/#adobe-i-o-console

Some modifications have been made so that a JWT token is generated and Access token fetched automatically as a prerequisite to every call as well as a fix for get audience by id.

## Usage
After imporing both the collection and environment files, be sure to fill out the environment variables for your Adobe IO integration by clicking on the gear button in the upper right corner of Postman.
